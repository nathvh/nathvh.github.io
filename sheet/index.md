# Getting Started

Creating a static website from markdown files is as simple as creating those markdown files on your file system and
telling the `markdown-docs` library how you want to convert them to HTML.

1. Take a look at the files created on your file system at `./sheet`

2. Create new markdown files here or modify existing ones.

3. Update your configuration file at `.\sheet\markdown-docs.js` to modify site title, colors, and the template to use.

## Start the Server

Run the local server with the command `markdown-docs dev ./sheet` and open a browser to the URL specified.
